# linear_regression_gradient_descent
Implementing gradient descent to minimize the cost function: using libraried in python: Panda

Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm.
Cost function is mean of squared error between hypothesis and output values.
Hypothesis function is used to predict output given a random input, it has learned its parameters from the training data by gradient descent.
